# Re-Uploading High-Quality Subsets to nextPYP

After obtaining the final subset of images with high-quality features in both the real and Fourier domains, we can make a new `mrcs` folder for uploading to nextPYP in order to perform subsequent processing.

We will use the outputs generated by the previous `intersect` command to help save some re-computation.

### Activate the Environment

```bash
conda activate prismpyp
```

### Create a New `mrcs` Folder for the Subset

Run the following command to generate a new `mrcs` folder that can be re-imported to your cryoSPARC project:

```bash
prismpyp upload_nextpyp \
--output-folder intersection \
--link-type soft \
--mrc-path /path/to/original/mrcs
```

### Output Files

The following output will be written to the `intersection/` directory:

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `mrcs` | The `.mrc` files for the actual intersected micrographs (either symlinked or copied) |

### Importing Results Back Into nextPYP

1. Create an `Import Raw Data` block and supply the path to the intersected `.mrc` files as the `Location` field: `/path/to/prismpyp/intersection/mrcs`
2. Fill out the other microscope parameters accordingly
3. Run the Import Raw Data block
4. Connect the outputs of the Import Raw Data block to a Pre-Processing block
5. Run the Pre-Procesing block
6. Continue with other jobs as needed
